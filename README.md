# UK Employment Dataset Analysis 2011-2014

In this project, I analyzed an **employment dataset for the UK** using a combination of **Excel** for data processing and **Tableau** for visualization. The analysis focuses on three main areas:
- **Employment by Industries**
- **Employment by Cities**
- **Employment by Sub-industries**

The goal was to uncover insights into employment trends in the UK from 2011 to 2014, providing a clearer understanding of how employment varied across different industries, cities, and sub-industries.

## Project Overview

The UK employment dataset contains information about employment distribution across various industries, cities, and sub-industries. Using **Excel**, I cleaned and processed the data, then utilized **Tableau** to create dynamic visualizations. These visualizations help to identify employment patterns, growth rates, and regional variations across different sectors.

### Key Areas of Focus:
- **Employment by Industries**: Analysis of employment trends in various industries (e.g., Technology, Healthcare, Manufacturing).
- **Employment by Cities**: Exploring employment distribution across major cities in the UK.
- **Employment by Sub-industries**: A deeper dive into employment trends within specific sub-industries.

## Tools Used:
- **Microsoft Excel**:
  - Data cleaning and transformation (e.g., handling missing values, reshaping raw data).
  - Creating pivot tables and summary statistics to understand key trends.
  
- **Tableau**:
  - Data visualization through interactive dashboards and charts.
  - Visualizing trends across industries, cities, and sub-industries with a focus on year-over-year changes.

## Steps Involved:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation in Excel**:
   - Cleaned the raw data by handling missing values and structuring the dataset for analysis.
   - Used **pivot tables** to summarize employment data by industry, city, and sub-industry.
   
2. **Data Import and Transformation for Tableau**:
   - Exported the cleaned data from Excel and imported it into Tableau.
   - Transformed the data to create calculated fields for employment growth rates and comparisons across different years.

3. **Creating Tableau Visualizations**:
   - Designed interactive **dashboards** that show trends in employment across industries, cities, and sub-industries.
   - Key visualizations include:
     - Employment by **Industry** over time.
     - **City-level employment distribution**.
     - **Sub-industry employment shifts** between 2011 and 2014.

## Visualizations
